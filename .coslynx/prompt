For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. It also includes 3D components (ThreeScene and Spline) for interactive 3D content. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Create designs that are:
- Modern and visually striking
- Performance optimized
- Accessible and responsive
- Interactive with smooth animations and 3D elements
- Cross-browser compatible
- SEO-friendly
- Mobile-first approach

Follow these design principles:
- Use whitespace effectively
- Maintain visual hierarchy
- Implement consistent typography
- Create intuitive navigation
- Use color schemes that enhance user experience
- Add subtle animations and transitions
- Incorporate 3D elements where they add value
- Ensure proper contrast ratios
- Include loading states and error handling
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals

Code structure should be:
- Clean and maintainable
- Component-based architecture
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Reusable custom hooks
- Efficient state management
- 3D component integration with proper fallbacks
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Error boundary implementation
- Unit test coverage for critical components
